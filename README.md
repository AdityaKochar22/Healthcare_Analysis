## Project Overview:
The primary goal of this data science project is to analyze various patient records, including admissions, diagnoses, bed occupancy, medical tests, and billing information. The analysis aims to provide insights into hospital resource utilization, patient health trends, and financial aspects of healthcare services. By understanding key trends in hospital admissions, common diagnoses, and billing distribution, healthcare providers can optimize patient care, manage hospital resources efficiently, and enhance financial planning.
## Dataset Description:
The dataset used for this project is called the "Papollo Healthcare Dataset." It contains 7,157 patient records spanning from December 2022 to March 2024, covering various aspects of hospital admissions, medical procedures, and patient feedback. The dataset includes the following key sections:

1. Patient Demographics & Admissions
The dataset records unique patient admissions, along with details such as admission date, discharge date, and follow-up schedules.
Trends in patient influx over time can help hospitals forecast demand for medical services.
2. Common Diagnoses & Medical Tests
The dataset provides insights into frequently diagnosed medical conditions, such as Viral Infections, Malaria, and Typhoid.
Analysis of medical tests (MRI, CT Scans, Blood Tests, etc.) helps in understanding diagnostic trends and test utilization.
3. Bed Occupancy & Hospital Resource Management
Patients are categorized into different bed types (General, ICU, and Private).
Understanding bed occupancy rates over time can assist in capacity planning and resource allocation.
4. Financial Insights: Billing & Insurance
The dataset includes billing amounts and insurance coverage for each patient.
Analyzing billing trends and insurance claims can help hospitals optimize cost structures and revenue management.
5. Patient Satisfaction & Follow-ups
The dataset contains patient feedback scores, providing insights into hospital service quality.
Follow-up trends indicate how quickly patients return for check-ups, highlighting post-hospitalization care effectiveness.
